       letters for generic references (the filter dialog box).

       .. note::
          A dialog box is usually modal, which means that you can't
          minimize it and must respond to it before proceeding. In
          contrast, you can keep a window open but minimized while
          working on another task.

     -
     - In UI environments, *drag* refers to using the mouse to "pull"
       an item from one area of the screen to another area. Because the
       action of dropping (releasing the mouse button) is intrinsic to
       the action of dragging items in a UI, don't use *drag and drop*
       as a verb.

       *Use:*
