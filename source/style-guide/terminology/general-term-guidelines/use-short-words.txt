Use Short, Familiar Words and Phrases
=====================================

.. include:: /style-guide/includes/page-needs-update.rst

Use short, familiar words and phrases to convey an idea clearly. Such
words and phrases are more conversational, save space, are easier to
scan, and are often easier for non-native English speakers to
understand. Use a longer word or phrase only if necessary to convey a
particular meaning.

If a word has variant spellings that are equally acceptable (such as
*canceled* and *cancelled*), use the shorter spelling.
