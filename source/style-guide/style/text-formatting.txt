Text Formatting
===============

.. include:: /style-guide/includes/page-needs-update.rst

Sometimes text should be formatted differently to designate a special
meaning or to make the text stand out. Usually this formatting is
accomplished by applying a different font treatment (bold, italics, or
monospace).

.. note::

   *Monospace* is also called a *fixed-pitch* or *fixed-width* font. In
   monospace, each letter and character occupy the same amount of
   horizontal space. An example of a monospace font is Courier, and it
   looks as follows: ``monospace font``

Use the following general guidelines when formatting text:

-  To apply a font treatment, use the appropriate markup in your
   authoring tool. In RST, use a directive if one is available.
-  Don't apply font treatments to text in titles and headings.
-  Don't use capitalization to emphasize a term (for example, showing a
   general term in all capitals).
-  Don't use color alone to distinguish text.
-  Use quotation marks only as directed in this topic and in
   :ref:`quotation-marks`.

The following table shows the text formatting to use for different text
elements. The following style differences are highlighted:

- Content for Public Cloud versus Private Cloud
- Content that documents a CLI or API versus a GUI
