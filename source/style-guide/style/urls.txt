URLs and Domain Names
=====================

.. include:: /style-guide/includes/page-needs-update.rst

Some samples, such as those related to the Customer Service Layer API,
include a sample customer's URL or email address. Don't invent a fake
domain name for this purpose. Even if that name isn't registered today,
someone might claim it tomorrow. Instead, use a domain name permanently
reserved for the purpose of demonstration and documentation.
**example.com** and **example.org** are reserved globally by the
Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).

Because the domain named **example.com** and the user named *Joe User*
don't and never will exist, it's safe to use the email address
**joe.user@example.com**.
