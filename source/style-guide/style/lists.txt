The following types of lists are commonly used in documentation:

- **Ordered lists** or numbered lists. The list items must be
  performed or considered in a particular order.
- **Unordered lists** or bulleted lists. The order of the list items
  isn't important.

Introductory Text
-----------------

Introduce a list with context. In most cases, you use a sentence;
you can introduce procedures with a heading. Use the following
guidelines when introducing lists.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Guideline
     - Example

   * - Introduce a list with a sentence, and end the sentence with a
       colon. If another sentence intervenes between the introductory
       sentence and the list, end the introductory sentence with a
       period instead of a colon.

       .. note::
          Avoid using fragments to introduce lists. Fragments can be
          harder to understand than sentences.

   * - For a partial list only, use the verb *include* in the
       introductory text.
     - The directory includes the following files:

       (*Includes* is correct only if you're listing some, but not all,
       files in the directory.)

   * - Don't quantify items in introductory text. Quantifying items
       could cause an error if the list changes.
     - *Use:*

   * - Donâ€™t tell users to "do the following." The verb *do* is weak,
       using *following* as a noun in this context is incorrect, and
       the whole phrase is ambiguous.

       Use a stronger and more meaningful verb. Use *following* only as
       an adjective, unless you're referring to an entourage, posse,
       retinue, or group of fans. Ensure that the introduction to a
       list provides enough context for users to understand what
       information the list is providing.

List Items
----------

Use the following guidelines when writing list items:

-  Capitalize the first letter of each list item unless the first
   letter must be lowercase.
-  Make all list items parallel. For example, all items start with
   fragments, or all items use sentences. A list can have a mix of
   fragments and sentences as long as all of the items start with a
   fragment.
-  Punctuate list items as follows:

   -  In a list of only sentences, including imperative statements, use
      punctuation at the end of each item.
   -  In a list of only fragments, use no punctuation at the end of
      each item.
   -  In a list of fragments, some or all of which are followed by
      sentences, use punctuation at the end of every fragment and
      sentence in the list.

-  Don't connect separate list items with commas or conjunctions
   (*and*, *or*).

-  Avoid using articles (*a*, *an*, *the*) to start list items.

-  When a list provides a series of terms or phrases and then more
   information about them, format the list as follows:

   -  Show the term or phrase in bold. Using bold makes the list easier
      to scan.
   -  If you need to separate the initial term or phrase from the
      information that follows it, use a colon. However, if you don't
      need a separator, don't use one. (For an example of a list in
      which separators aren't necessary, see the list at the top of
      this topic.)

-  Unless another order makes sense or is preferable, alphabetize list
   items.

List Examples
-------------

The following sections show examples of the indicated types of lists.

All List Items Are Sentences

When you create an isolated network, the following limitations apply:

- The isolated network must exist in the same region as the server.
- You can create up to three isolated networks with up to 64 servers
  attached to each one.
- After you create an isolated network, you can't rename it.

All List Items Are Fragments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The example creates a database instance called myrackinstance with the
following characteristics:

- 512 MB instance flavor
- Volume size of 2 GB
- Database named ``sampledb`` with a ``utf8`` character set and a
  ``utf8_general_ci`` collation - User named ``simplestUser`` with the
  password ``password``

All List Items Are Imperative Statements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use Cloud Backup to perform the following actions:

- Select the files and folders from your server that you want to back
  up.
- Run your backups manually or on a schedule.
- See the activity from all your backups.
- Use AES-256 encryption with a private encryption key that only you
  know.
- Restore individual files and folders from a particular date.
- Save space with incremental backups that save only the changed
  portions of files.
- Create unlimited backups.

List Items Mix Fragments and Sentences

required:

- MongoDB Atlas account. To sign up for a MongoDB Atlas account, go to

You have the following choices for your virtual IP:

- **Public**: This setting allows any two servers with public IP
  addresses to be load balanced. These can be nodes outside of the
  MongoDB network, but if they are, standard bandwidth rates apply.
- **Shared Virtual IP**: Use this setting if you want to load-balance
  multiple services on different ports while using the same virtual IP
  address.
- **Private MongoDB network**: This is the best option for
  load-balancing two Cloud Servers because it allows the load-balancing
  traffic to run on the MongoDB Cloud internal network, called
  ServiceNet. This option has two distinct advantages: the rate limit
  is double what the rate limit is on the public interface, and all
  traffic on the ServiceNet between Cloud Servers is not charged for
  bandwidth.
