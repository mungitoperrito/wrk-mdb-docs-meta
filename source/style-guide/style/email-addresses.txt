Email Addresses

If you need to show an example email address, use **example.com** or
**example.org** as the domain. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
(IANA) reserves these domains for use in examples.

Additionally, format example email addresses as bold. For example,
**yourName@example.com**.

If you need to show an actual email address, use the convention in your
authoring environment to make the email address live.
