.. _version-reference:

==================
Version Reference
==================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

References to product versions should follow a consistent pattern to make them
easier to find when support ends for a given release.

Directives
----------

Snooty provides three directives for version references:

.. hlist::
   :columns: 2

   * ``versionadded``
   * ``versionchanged``
   * ``deprecated``

These directives should take the version number as an argument and contain a
description of the added, changed, or deprecated feature.

.. code-block:: rst

   .. versionadded:: 6.0
      
      Wizbang feature provides foobar.

Alternatively, the version directive can be set to mark a section or table row
as relevant to a specific version:

.. code-block:: rst

   Section
   -------

   .. deprecated:: 5.0

   This feature does xyz.


Inline
------

You also reference versions inline.  The first reference to a particular
release version in a paragraph should always include the product name,
(e.g. *MongoDB 6.0*).  

Consistency in this area makes it easier for us to later identify inline 
references to EOL releases of the product.
