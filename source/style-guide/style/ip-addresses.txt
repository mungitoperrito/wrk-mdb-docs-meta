IP Addresses

An *IP address* uses a sequence of numbers to uniquely identify a
particular computer on the Internet.

When you're discussing IP addresses or referring to a specific IP
address, don't use *IP* only; use *IP address*. You don't need to
spell out *IP* on first use.

When you need to refer to a specific version of the IP, use *IPv4
address* or *IPv6 address* as appropriate.

   * - Examples
   * - If your website is hosted in the DFW data center, you can use
       the following primary and secondary IP addresses:

       • Primary: 74.205.61.228

       • Secondary: 74.205.61.229

       • Additional: 72.32.36.144/28 (72.32.36.145 - 72.32.36.158)
   * - Each Vyatta appliance is assigned one public IPv4 address.
   * - If you're using IPv6 on your server, you might need to add the
       IPv6 addresses of your name servers to the **resolv.conf** file.

If you need to show an example IP address, don't use one that is or
might be assigned to a computer. Instead, use one that's globally
defined for documentation. Valid IPv4 address blocks are provided in
:rfc:`RFC 5737 <5737>`, and a valid IPv6 prefix is provided in
:rfc:`RFC 3849 <3849>`.
