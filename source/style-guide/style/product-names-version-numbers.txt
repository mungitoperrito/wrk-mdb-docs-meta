Product Names and Version Numbers
=================================

.. include:: /style-guide/includes/page-needs-update.rst

When using MongoDB product names and showing version numbers, use
the following guidelines:

-  Always spell out and properly capitalize MongoDB product and
   service names (for example, Cloud Servers and Cloud Files).

-  In some cases, you can refer to the product generically after using
   the product name. For example, after you introduce the Cloud
   Monitoring Agent, you can refer to simply *the agent*.

-  Don't capitalize an item that a user creates through a MongoDB
   service. For example, users use the Cloud Servers service to create
   a *server*, not a *Server*, and they use the Cloud Load Balancer
   service to create a *load balancer*, not a *Load Balancer*.

-  Don't abbreviate MongoDB names, unless the abbreviation has been
   approved by the Legal and Marketing departments. For example, never
   abbreviate Cloud Block Storage as CBS.

-  For API documentation, the version number in the documentation
   should match the version number of the software. The combination of
   the API version number and the publication date identify the
   document version.

When using third-party company and product names, use the name as it's
used by the third-party. For a list of commonly used third-party names,
see :ref:`third-party-names-and-trademarks`.

When referring to an OpenStack service, use the actual service name,
and provide the project name in parentheses. For example, use OpenStack
Block Storage (Cinder). On subsequent references, use the service name
instead of the project name, unless you need to use project names to
differentiate between two versions of one service. See the `OpenStack
documentation conventions
<http://docs.openstack.org/contributor-guide/writing-style/openstack-components.html>`__
for service and project names.
