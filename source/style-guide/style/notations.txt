Notations (notes, tips, and warnings) call out important or helpful
information. Use them sparingly, according to the guidelines in the
following table.

   * - Notation type
     - Description
   * - Important
     - Presents an important or essential point. As a rule, users must
       pay attention to important notations to complete a task or
       understand a topic.
   * - Note
     - Provides information that emphasizes or supplements information
       in the text. A note can provide information that applies only in
       certain cases.
   * - Tip
     - Provides useful information that might improve product
       performance or make procedures easier to follow. Tips provide
       the following benefits:

       • Help users learn techniques or procedures
       • Show alternative ways of doing something
       • Provide shortcuts
       • Provide helpful (but not essential) information

   * - Warning
     - Alerts users to potential hazards or highlights critical
       information. Use a warning for situations in which users could
       lose data, compromise data integrity, or disrupt operations if
       they don't follow instructions carefully.

When creating notations, use the following guidelines:

-  Use the style or element in your authoring tool to create the
   notation.

-  If there is no style or element, or if you are showing the notation
   in a table cell, create the notation as follows: Type the word
   **Important**, **Note**, **Tip**, or **Warning**, make the word
   bold, follow it with a colon, and then provide the text of the
   notation in regular font.

-  Place a notation as close as possible to the information that it
   emphasizes or clarifies.

-  Don't "stack" notations of the same type (for example, by following
   one labeled note directly with another labeled note). Instead, use
   separate paragraphs or an unordered list within a single notation.
   It is acceptable for notations of different types to follow one
   another.
