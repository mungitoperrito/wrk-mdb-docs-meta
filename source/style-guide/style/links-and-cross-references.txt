Links and Cross-References
==========================

.. include:: /style-guide/includes/page-needs-update.rst

Use cross-references to help users navigate content and find content
that's related to what they're currently viewing. Cross-references can
be linked or not linked, depending on the location of the content to
which you're referring.

-  When you refer to content within the same article or section, such
   as tables, figures, examples, or a subsection, create a simple
   textual cross-reference that isn't linked.

   Users typically expect links to take them to a location outside of
   the article or section that they're currently reading, so links that
   just jump to another place in the same article or section can be
   confusing. Exceptions are a TOC, or *jump list*, at the top of an
   article or section that provides links to the high-level headings in
   the article or section, and "back to top" links that take the user
   back to the top of the page.

-  When you refer to other content, whether created by MongoDB or
   outside of MongoDB, provide a link to that content. Ensure that the
   link is active and that the content is up-to-date. Periodically
   check the link and content.

Use the following guidelines to create clear and specific
cross-references and links. For examples, see the table at the end of
the topic.

- Begin a cross-reference sentence by explaining the purpose or benefit
  of the cross-reference (such as more information or examples). Such
  context helps users decide whether to follow the reference.

- Use *information about* rather than *information on*.

- Use *preceding* and *following* to locate information in an article
  or topic. Don't use *above*, *below*, *earlier*, or *later*.

- Ensure that the text of a link sufficiently describes the destination
  content.

  - For links at the end of an article or topic that point to related
    information or to a next step, use the title of or a heading in the
    destination content as the link text.

  - When links are inline, use about three or four words of existing
    text as the link text. Choose words that best describe the
    destination content.

  - If existing text can't sufficiently describe the destination
    content, create a cross-reference sentence for the link. For the
    link text, use the title of or a heading in the destination
    content, if possible. Avoid providing an actual URL, unless you
    think that having the URL is helpful for the user.

  - Don't provide links from ambiguous phrases such as *Click here* or
    *More information*.

  .. note::

     Provide links *inline* only when it's necessary or helpful for the
     user to follow the link to understand the current topic or
     complete the task. Provide links to related but not essential
     information, and to next steps, at the end of the article or
     section.

- If a link points to a location other than the current site (for
  example, out of the Support website or away from
  docs.MongoDB.com), provide context that describes the location.

- Don't code a link to open in a new tab or window. Users can choose
  whether they want open a link in a new tab or window.

- If your article or topic has multiple subheadings, provide a TOC
  (jump list) at the beginning of the article or topic, after an
  introduction. Use the heading text as the link text, and typically
  link only to the top-level headings in the article or topic.

  .. note::

     If the UI automatically builds a TOC or jump list for the article,
     don't duplicate it by creating one manually within the article.

- Don't use quotation marks around link text.

- Create and format links according to the authoring tool that you're
  using. Test links to ensure that they're live and that they point to
  the correct destination.

- Don't link to information more than once in an article or topic.
