This section of the style guide provides detailed guidelines about and
instructions for applying markup conventions for ReStructure Text (RST)
and MarkDown (MD).

ReStructured Text (RST)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB documentation uses reStructuredText (RST) markup syntax
with Sphinx extensions.

RST is a powerful and straightforward markup language that, in
combination with Sphinx, provides a wide range of facilities for
intelligent and appealing documentation creation. It uses simple
and implicit syntax to introduce a variety of content elements such
as titles, code blocks, vertical lists, and many others. All the
source content formatted using RST is stored in files with the ``.rst``
extension.

For more information on the RST conventions the Information Development
team follows, see the following resources:

* `OpenStack RST conventions <https://docs.openstack.org/contributor-guide/rst-conv.html>`_.

MarkDown (MD)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MD is a straightforward markup language that uses simple and implicit
syntax to introduce a variety of content elements. All the source
content formatted using MD is stored in files with the ``.md``
extension.

To keep the documentation format consistent, follow the guidelines
included in this chapter for all the MD source content.

For more information about MD conventions, see the following
