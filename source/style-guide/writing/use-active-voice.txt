Use Active Voice
================

Active voice makes the performer of the action (usually the user) the
subject of the sentence. Passive voice makes the recipient of the
action (not the performer) the subject of the sentence.

Active-voice sentences are more engaging, less complicated, less wordy,
and easier to understand than passive-voice sentences. With active
voice, the actions and responses of the user are easier to distinguish
from the actions and responses of the technology.

However, passive voice is acceptable in the following situations:

-  Using active voice sounds like you're blaming the user. For
   example, you can use passive voice in an error message or
   troubleshooting content when the active subject is the user.
-  The performer of action is unknown, or you want to de-emphasize the
   performer of the action and emphasize the object on which the
   action is performed.
-  Using active voice makes the sentence wordy or awkward.
