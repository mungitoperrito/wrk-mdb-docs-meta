===========================
Use Interjections with Care
===========================

An interjection is an emotional greeting or phrase, usually followed by
an exclamation point. For example, expressions such as *Hooray!*,
*Excuse me!*, *Sorry!*, *No thank you!*, *Oh dear!*, and *Hey, that's
mine!* are interjections.

In rare cases, an interjection might be appropriate in technical
content. For example, at the end of a procedure that targets novice
users, you might write, "Congratulations! You successfully created your
first cloud server."

However, because the tone of an interjection can be condescending, use
them sparingly and with care.
