Use Present Tense
=================

.. include:: /includes/styles/corrections.rst

Users read content to help them perform tasks or to gather information.
These activities occur in the users' present time, so the present tense
is appropriate in most content. The present tense implies that users
should take action now. Sentences that use the present tense are easier
to read than sentences that use past or future tense.

The future tense can imply a sense of uncertainty. (We can't truly
guarantee a future action, regardless of expectation!) Use future tense
only when you need to emphasize that something occurs later, from the
users' perspective.

.. tip::

   To easily find and remove instances of future tense, search for
   *will*.
