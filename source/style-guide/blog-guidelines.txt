Blog Guidelines
===============

When you write a blog post, your grammar should be correct but you do
not have to adhere strictly to the technical documentation Style Guide.
The following guidelines are specific to writing blog posts for the
`MongoDB Blog <https://www.mongodb.com/blog>`__.

Blog Manifesto
--------------

For the goodness of the reader through the betterment of the company:
the core principles for communicating through the blog will be...

Style: Personal, Professional, Conversational
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Always address the reader personally

  - Because you are looking to engage them

  - But never try to be a buddy

- Always address the reader professionally

  - Because you want to establish your credentials as a peer

  - Avoid appeals to authority unless you are the authority

- Always address the reader conversationally

  - Because this is a blog, not a formal news release (usually)

  - But avoid writing a conversation

Form: Narrative, Focus, Enjoy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Always try to talk narratively

  - Because narrative style guides the reader’s attention

  - But, treat the opener as a TL;DR - don’t tease.

- Focus on communicating one core thing

  - Because there is always another blog article for other things

  - Don’t waste the reader’s attention

- Write so you are enjoying writing

  - Because words written honestly communicate your feelings

Approach: Topicality, Solutions, Inspiration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Look for a topical approach to frame your writing

  - Find a current trend, report, article to ride on because currency
    counts

  - But avoid memes and fads, they age stories in days.

- Look to solve a problem for the reader

  - Even if its one they don’t have yet.

  - But don’t make it sound like they created the problem

- Aim to give at least some of the readers an “Aha!” moment

  - Because that’s the greatest gift you can give to a reader

  - And remember some “Aha!” moments may appear mundane
