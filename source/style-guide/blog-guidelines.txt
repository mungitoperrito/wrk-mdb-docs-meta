This topic provides additional guidelines specific to writing blogs for
the MongoDB Developer Blog site.


Things to consider before writing a blog
----------------------------------------

Before you start writing, consider the following questions:

- What is the goal of this developer blog? Describe it in two sentences
  or less.

  - Is it to be helpful and answer a question or offer how-to
    information?
  - Is it to provide “thought leadership” or show our expertise in an
    area? If so, describe what you’d like to convey.
  - Is it something else altogether? If so, what? It’s possible that
    your idea might be better presented as an article on the How-To
    support site at https://support.MongoDB.com/ or as a blog with a
    marketing flavor published at https://blog.MongoDB.com/.

- What is the significance of the content of the blog? Is it how to use
  a new offering? How is it helpful to customers? Does it frame our
  expertise is a new way?
- Explain how the content of the blog aligns with, supports, or
  strengthens MongoDB’s current business priorities and strategy.
- Who is the target audience for this blog?
- What specific customer problems or pain points does the blog address?
  Provide names of customers willing to be references in support of the post.
- Does the blog describe how to use something that MongoDB provides
  that it does better than the competition or that no other competitor
  offers? Does the blog provide quantifiable and defensible information
  (such as performance metrics) showing the MongoDB edge over the
  competition? If yes, explain.


Blog writing suggestions
------------------------

When you write your content, we recommend the following rules of thumb:

-  Length: MongoDB blog posts generally run between 500-1,000 words,
   but let the content be your guide. Take the space you need to tell
   your story, but don’t pad it unnecessarily. Going long is okay, too,
   as long as it’s worth reading.

-  Tools: Use the word processor or text editor of your choice to write
   the blog.

-  General format:

   - An attention-grabbing opening, known in the news business as a
     “lede”

   - A “nut graf” - a sentence or two letting readers know what you’re
     going to be talking about and why it matters

   - Some background information or context, such as the history of a
     product

   - A conclusion (and a call to action, if appropriate) with links and
     contact information

- Consistency: Be as consistent as possible in style with other blogs
  on the MongoDB Developer Blog site.

- Bullet points: Bullet points are useful for listing features.

- Images:

  - Images should directly support or illustrate blog content. Examples
    include a screen shot, diagram, or table that illustrates the
    concept or technique that is being described.
  - Any image pulled from another source should provide a reference to
    the source directly underneath the image.
  - Add social media icons with their links for twitter, Facebook, and
    LinkedIn at the bottom of the blog post. (Information Development
    provides a template for this that you can add to your blog.)

- Reference section: If your content uses a lot of content from another
  source, provide a Reference section at the bottom of the blog post
  with a link to the reference.

- Think “be helpful” rather than trying to sell a product or service.
  *What* does the product do? *How* does it help the customer?

- Write a good lede: When crafting your lede, consider how the
  information in your post helps customers. An announcement of a new
  product is not a lede, but that product’s money-saving capacity may
  well be one. For example:

  Not good: Today MongoDB is pleased to announce the release of four
  new features in Office 365.

  Good: Increased storage, security, and cost-saving measures are now
  available to enhance the already-robust Office 365 suite available
  from MongoDB, making it even more attractive to a wider variety of
  business users.

- Stay focused on your topic: If you find yourself straying, you may
  have enough material for a series. It’s okay to break up a big topic
  into more digestible bites. Formulas like How to, Top 5 or 10, and
  curated lists tend to do well.

- Show don’t tell. Can you create a graphic or image, or add a screen
  shot to illustrate your point?

- Avoid jargon. Rackers (and the entire tech industry) tend to speak in
  jargon. Unless your post is aimed at a technical audience, use plain
  English. There is never a reason to use business jargon.

- Link link link: A first product mention? Link to the product page.
  Outside accolades? Link to it. Citing a study or source or article?
  Link to it. Have we written about it before? Link to it. Mention a
  partner or customer? Link to their site.

- Keep it concise: The Internet has shrunken everyone’s attention span.
  Say it once, say it well. No need to repeat the same information in
  different format. Similarly, keep paragraphs short. Long blocks of
  text are intimidating. Use concrete examples whenever possible. If
  you get stuck, don’t fret. Just send your draft to the blog team.

Voice and tone
--------------

Use these guidelines to write a blog that is friendly, helpful, and
inspires confidence.

The primary job of the words in a blog is to help users complete tasks
with no confusion and minimal interruption. However, the voice and tone
that we use with words also influence how people think and feel about
MongoDB.

Voice is our style, and communicates our personality to the user. Tone
is our mood, and communicates our attitude about the subject to the
user.

The words we choose, and the ways we use them, should reflect our
goals: building trust, inspiring confidence, making things easier, and
developing a relationship with MongoDB users.

When you write blog text, use words that reflect the following
attributes:

- Human
- Trustworthy
- Knowledgeable
- Accurate
- Professional
- Approachable
- Helpful

Consider the following best practices for voice and tone when you write
blog text:

- Write in a way that the user wants to be spoken to. Use helpful words
  and phrases that are informative, simple, clear, and easy to
  understand.

- Temper the enthusiasm conveyed in confirmation messages.

- Be careful about laying blame. Don’t take the blame for a negative
  situation. Don’t lay the blame of the negative situation on the user.

- In positive situations, be encouraging and offer next steps. Don’t
  take credit for the user’s success.

- In negative situations, be clear about the problem and how the user
  can fix it. Don’t ask the user to trust us without providing more
  information.



Write to the user by using second person and imperative mood
------------------------------------------------------------

Users are more engaged with content when it talks to them directly. You
talk to users directly by using *second person*, addressing the user as
*you*. Second person also promotes a friendly tone. For more
information, see :ref:`write-to-the-user`.

The following guidelines for writing to the user apply specifically to
the MongoDB developer blogs:

-  For blogs, use the first-person singular pronoun *I* only when
   authors of blogs are describing their own actions or opinions.

-  Switching person (point of view) is acceptable in blog posts that
   use first-person singular but then switch to second person for
   instructional steps.
