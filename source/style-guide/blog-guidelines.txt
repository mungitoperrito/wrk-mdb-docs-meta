This topic provides additional guidelines specific to writing blogs for
the MongoDB Developer Blog site.


Things to consider before writing a blog
----------------------------------------

Before you start writing, consider the following questions:

- What is the goal of this developer blog? Describe it in two sentences
  or less.

  - Is it to be helpful and answer a question or offer how-to
    information?
  - Is it to provide “thought leadership” or show our expertise in an
    area? If so, describe what you’d like to convey.
  - Is it something else altogether? If so, what? It’s possible that
    your idea might be better presented as an article on the How-To
    support site at https://support.MongoDB.com/ or as a blog with a
    marketing flavor published at https://blog.MongoDB.com/.

- What is the significance of the content of the blog? Is it how to use
  a new offering? How is it helpful to customers? Does it frame our
  expertise is a new way?
- Explain how the content of the blog aligns with, supports, or
  strengthens MongoDB’s current business priorities and strategy.
- Who is the target audience for this blog?
- What specific customer problems or pain points does the blog address?
  Provide names of customers willing to be references in support of the post.
- Does the blog describe how to use something that MongoDB provides
  that it does better than the competition or that no other competitor
  offers? Does the blog provide quantifiable and defensible information
  (such as performance metrics) showing the MongoDB edge over the
  competition? If yes, explain.


Blog writing suggestions
------------------------

When you write your content, we recommend the following rules of thumb:

-  Length: MongoDB blog posts generally run between 500-1,000 words,
   but let the content be your guide. Take the space you need to tell
   your story, but don’t pad it unnecessarily. Going long is okay, too,
   as long as it’s worth reading.

-  Tools: Use the word processor or text editor of your choice to write
   the blog.

-  General format:

   - An attention-grabbing opening, known in the news business as a
     “lede”

   - A “nut graf” - a sentence or two letting readers know what you’re
     going to be talking about and why it matters

   - Some background information or context, such as the history of a
     product

   - A conclusion (and a call to action, if appropriate) with links and
     contact information

- Consistency: Be as consistent as possible in style with other blogs
  on the MongoDB Developer Blog site.

- Bullet points: Bullet points are useful for listing features.

- Images:

  - Images should directly support or illustrate blog content. Examples
    include a screen shot, diagram, or table that illustrates the
    concept or technique that is being described.
  - Any image pulled from another source should provide a reference to
    the source directly underneath the image.
  - Add social media icons with their links for twitter, Facebook, and
    LinkedIn at the bottom of the blog post. (Information Development
    provides a template for this that you can add to your blog.)

- Reference section: If your content uses a lot of content from another
  source, provide a Reference section at the bottom of the blog post
  with a link to the reference.

For the goodness of the reader through the betterment of the company:
the core principles for communicating through the blog will be...

Style: Personal, Professional, Conversational
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Always address the reader personally

  - Because you are looking to engage them

  - But never try to be a buddy

- Always address the reader professionally

  - Because you want to establish your credentials as a peer

  - Avoid appeals to authority unless you are the authority

- Always address the reader conversationally

  - Because this is a blog, not a formal news release (usually)

  - But avoid writing a conversation

Form: Narrative, Focus, Enjoy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Always try to talk narratively

  - Because narrative style guides the reader’s attention

  - But, treat the opener as a TL;DR - don’t tease.

- Focus on communicating one core thing

  - Because there is always another blog article for other things

  - Don’t waste the reader’s attention

- Write so you are enjoying writing

  - Because words written honestly communicate your feelings

Approach: Topicality, Solutions, Inspiration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Look for a topical approach to frame your writing

  - Find a current trend, report, article to ride on because currency
    counts

  - But avoid memes and fads, they age stories in days.

- Look to solve a problem for the reader

  - Even if its one they don’t have yet.

  - But don’t make it sound like they created the problem

- Aim to give at least some of the readers an “Aha!” moment

  - Because that’s the greatest gift you can give to a reader

  - And remember some “Aha!” moments may appear mundane
