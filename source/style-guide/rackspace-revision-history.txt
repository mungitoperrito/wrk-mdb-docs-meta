Style guide revision history
============================

This file summarizes the changes that have been made to the style
guide.

March 12, 2019
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Because of the MongoDB rebranding in March 2019, added the new
  MongoDB tagline, Fanatical Experience™, to all relevant sections,
  but especially to
  :ref:`trademarks`.

  .. note::

     Mirroring its redoubled efforts to target large-enterprise
     customers more effectively, MongoDB replaced its Fanatical
     Support tagline with the more inclusive tagline, Fanatical
     Experience. The idea that every Racker must take partial ownership
     and responsibility toward each customer outcome continues to form
     the core ethos of its workplace culture.
