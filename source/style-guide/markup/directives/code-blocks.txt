As needed, use the appropriate language option for code blocks directives
including the following:

- ``code-block``
- ``io-code-block``
- ``literalinclude``

This enables syntax highlighting which makes the source code easier to
interpret. The following example shows how to specify Python language
syntax highlighting in a ``code-block`` directive:

.. code-block::

   .. code-block:: python

      print("Hello MongoDB") # Python code
