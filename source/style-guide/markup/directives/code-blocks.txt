As needed, use the appropriate language option for code blocks directives
including the following directives:

- ``code-block``
- ``io-code-block``
- ``literalinclude``

These directives feature syntax highlighting which makes the source code 
contained in them easier to interpret. The following example shows how to 
specify Python language syntax highlighting in a ``code-block`` directive:

.. code-block::

   .. code-block:: python

      print("Hello MongoDB") # Python code
