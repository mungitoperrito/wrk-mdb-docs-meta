Substitutions
=============

In Snooty, you can use variables to represent a text value in the
rendered form of the documentation. These variables are called
source constants. When used consistently, they help prevent inconsistencies in
formatting the term and make it easy to change the value for all its
occurrences.

Source Constants
----------------

Source constants define substitution text for variables in {+rst+} files.
When building the documentation, the substitution text replaces the instances
of the variables prior to {+docutils+} parser transforming the document to
HTML. You can use source constants within directives and roles.

You can add or modify source constants in your documentation repository's
``snooty.toml`` file in the base directory. Source constants should be
defined in the ``[constants]`` section using in the
``<name> = "substitution text"`` format.

For example, suppose you want to add a source constant that represents the
URL to the MDN documentation, "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/".
If you name the source constant "mdn", your ``snooty.toml`` file should
include the following line in the ``[constants]`` section:

.. code-block:: python

   mdn = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/"

Use the source constant as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: rst

   Read the `Game development <{ +mdn+ }Games>`__ article on MDN for information
   on creating web games.

.. important::

   In your {+rst+}, source constants shouldn't contain spaces between curly
   braces and plus signs as shown in the example. The spaces were
   intentionally added to the example to prevent the parser from substituting
   a value.
