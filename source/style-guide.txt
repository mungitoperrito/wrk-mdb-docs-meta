MongoDB external and internal customers.

   direct, and grammatically correct. This section explains fundamental
   standards for good technical writing.

:doc:`/style-guide/style/index`
   Provides information about how certain elements appear in MongoDB
   content. For example, how we show abbreviations, how we capitalize
   headings, whether we allow contractions, and what formatting we
   apply to certain text.

   Provides advice for using accurate, consistent, and concise
   terminology in your content, and for writing for a global audience.

   and diagrams to enhance your content.

:doc:`/style-guide/how-to-article-guidelines`
   Provides guidelines specifically for How-To articles that are
   published at https://docs.mongodb.com/guides/. Use these guidelines
   when writing any How-To articles for this site. You can share these
   guidelines with outside contributors that you are working with as an
   Technical Writer and use them as you review How-To articles
   written by outside contributors.

:doc:`/style-guide/error-message-guidelines`
   Provides guidelines specifically for error messages in MongoDB
   internal and external documentation. You can share these guidelines

:doc:`/style-guide/user-interface-guidelines`
   Provides links to the user interface guidelines in the MongoDB
   documentation. The MongoDB documentation includes text conventions
   for user interfaces. There is an effort to unify the look, feel, and

   designers and a UI toolkit for developers.
