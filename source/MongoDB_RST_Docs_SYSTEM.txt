MongoDB Docs System
Using rST with Sphinx/Giza

MongoDB Basics of Docs as Code
Setting
Standard
Reason
Character Set
ASCII
Giza and Sphinx can return errors from text that uses higher level Unicode characters, including non-printing ones.
Line length
Hard breaks at 72 characters
Per PEP-008 and Code Review tool does not text wrap.
Line endings
UNIX (LF)
macOS and UNIX (Linux) end lines with line feeds. Using this form eliminates rendering errors in your text editor.
Tabs
Use 2 spaces per tab
YAML cannot use tabs. PEP-008 specifies spaces.
End of File
Include a blank line
All cross-references are added to the bottom of each assembled rST page. Not having that extra space results in errors.
Variable and File Naming Convention
kebab-case
Existing MongoDB convention.
Indents
Use 2 spaces for each level, except under a directive, then use 3 spaces
rST follows PEP-008 conventions; text blocks must align to the same indent level.

How to markup basic formatting

Inline Markup Caveats
Only one format can be applied on one set of words
Set Bold or Italic, not both
Can’t monospace, bold or italicize text inside links or cross referencesLegacy only: An exception exists for this: the :xml: role. It’s complex.
Underline / overline length for a headline must equal number of characters of a headline


Explicit Markup
Explicit Markup covers certain formatting cases that need special consideration
These include:
Cross References
Substitutions
Links
Footnotes

Cross References
Come from four sources:
Built-in from docutils or Sphinx
Links between repos/sites uses the Intersphinx extension
Created inline
Created per repo in the conf.py or snooty.toml configuration file
Created for all repos in the docs-tools/snooty-parser repo
Can have explicit title and target
:doc:`Security </secure>` shows Security but links to /secure
Prefix with ~ to change the title to the last component of the target
:binary:`~bin.mongos` shows mongos but links to bin.mongos
Provide semantic links to other URLs either intrasite or intersite

Xref: Built-in docutils & Sphinx
Notation

:doc:

Common docutils and Sphinx cross references


Xref: Inline Targets and Links
To create cross references targets within a page, add this above one heading:
.. _reference:
To create a link to that specific cross reference:
:ref:`reference`
:ref:`display-text <reference>`
Try to keep cross references unique
Cross references work across all linked repositories
Use kebab-case, not:
camelCase
snake_case
TRAIN-CASE
SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
Kebab-case can result in bad line breaks that cause errors. Check refs and links for hyphenation breaks.
Create and reference targets in any file

Before converting from rST to HTML
Can use inside markup
No
Yes

Hyperlinks
Inline Hyperlinks
Use explicit markup.
`link text <http://example.com>`__
Recommend two underscores. Sphinx and docutils treat each link as unique when converting to HTML.
Use one underscore on two hyperlinks to same page and generate an error.
How to link to pages and sites outside of the docs
Referenced Hyperlinks
Write the target first in explicit markup format:
.. _a link: http://example.com
Reference the link 
This paragraph contains `a link`__
This method was used for links that appeared in multiple places.
Internal Hyperlinks
Use cross references

Footnotes
Use [#name]_ to mark the footnote location
Lorem ipsum [#f1]_ dolor sit amet ... [#f2]_ 
Add the footnote body at the bottom of the document after a “Footnotes” rubric heading:
.. rubric:: Footnotes
.. [#f1] Text of the first footnote.
.. [#f2] Text of the second footnote.

Directives
Feature
Code Example
Format a block of text
.. <directive>::
Can follow with roles that serve as directive options
.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
Add blank line between options and text if directive takes options
.. code-block:: sh

   cd /path/to/new-directory
Indent content to beginning of directive
.. note::

Pay attention to indents when nesting
Can insert a heading within a tab, but it must sense in the heading structure of the page (i.e. an H4 can't render directly after an H2)
Cannot link to a tab
How to show conditional content
.. tabs::

   .. tab:: <title1>

Tables
How to create tables the right way
Creates a table
Takes three options:
header-rows
stub-columns
widths
widths takes relative size of columns as integers separated by spaces. Add one entry per column.
Number of columns in widths must match number of columns in list table.
Use tables whenever you find you have written a list with one or more dashes, colons, or semicolons to separate content on each line.
Do not use an include to replace a table row. You may use an include within the content of a cell.
.. list-table::
   :header-rows: X
   :stub-columns: Y
   :widths: Z A B   * - Row 1, Column 1
     - Row 1, Column 2     - Row 1, Column 3

   * - Row 2, Column 1

YAML
How MongoDB got around the initial limitations of rST

YAML
With the initial limitations of docutils and Sphinx, MongoDB created giza to provide templated format blocks and publish documentation.
YAML template formats that are in heavy use:
extract
step
option
toc

All of these files must be saved at the root of the /includes/ directory.
