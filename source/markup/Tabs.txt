Tabs
Create tabs to display conditional content
Use repo-wide presets or per page types
Maintains setting between pages
Use only to provide between one or three options for a given topic like installing a program across multiple OS
Can be nested, hidden, or both
Pay attention to indents when nesting
Can insert a heading within a tab, but it must sense in the heading structure of the page (i.e. an H4 can't render directly after an H2)
Cannot link to a tab
