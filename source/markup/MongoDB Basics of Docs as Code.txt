MongoDB Basics of Docs as Code
Setting
Standard
Reason
Character Set
ASCII
Giza and Sphinx can return errors from text that uses higher level Unicode characters, including non-printing ones.
Line length
Hard breaks at 72 characters
Per PEP-008 and Code Review tool does not text wrap.
Line endings
UNIX (LF)
macOS and UNIX (Linux) end lines with line feeds. Using this form eliminates rendering errors in your text editor.
Tabs
Use 2 spaces per tab
YAML cannot use tabs. PEP-008 specifies spaces.
End of File
Include a blank line
All cross-references are added to the bottom of each assembled rST page. Not having that extra space results in errors.
Variable and File Naming Convention
kebab-case
Existing MongoDB convention.
Indents
Use 2 spaces for each level, except under a directive, then use 3 spaces
rST follows PEP-008 conventions; text blocks must align to the same indent level.
