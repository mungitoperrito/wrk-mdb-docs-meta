Tables
How to create tables the right way
Creates a table
Takes three options:
header-rows
stub-columns
widths
widths takes relative size of columns as integers separated by spaces. Add one entry per column.
Number of columns in widths must match number of columns in list table.
Use tables whenever you find you have written a list with one or more dashes, colons, or semicolons to separate content on each line.
Do not use an include to replace a table row. You may use an include within the content of a cell.
.. list-table::
   :header-rows: X
   :stub-columns: Y
   :widths: Z A B   * - Row 1, Column 1
     - Row 1, Column 2     - Row 1, Column 3
